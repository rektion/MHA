The manufacturer has announced that the truck will have an autonomy of 805 km with a full charge of its batteries, and that it could travel 640 km after a charge of 30 minutes which would give it 80% of its total charge when connected to a Tesla Megacharger solar charging station. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, said the base version of the Semi would come with Tesla autopilot, which enables semi-autonomous driving on highways.<br>Tesla is expanding its network of autonomous vehicles.
