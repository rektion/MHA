<!DOCTYPE html> <html><body><p class="titre"> FICHE DU SUJET Our rework robots will receive nonconform products from quality check robots. They also have access to all data that have been measured of the product. From there they can identifies the problem on this precise product. If the same default is spot too many times it goes up to the IA that manages the factory. It will be up to it to identify where the problem came from and to solve it. Additional measures will be taken on the faulty product to be able to know how if it can be solved or not. If it is not solvable the product is ejected from the line and goes elsewhere to be recycle. Other way the product is reworked and put back on the classic line to go to packaging.</p><br><A style="color:Tomato;">[est le texte de]</A><br><A HREF = "FAAA18932.html">Rework Robots</A><br></body></html>
