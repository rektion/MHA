After the sensors recognize the position of the ceiling grid frame material to insert ceiling suspension bolts, one arm lifts up a ceiling board to the correct position, while the other arm screws the board to the base material. At the laboratory, they are checking the Robo-Buddy's ability to install boards at a high-rise building in Osaka, as well as performance under varying construction conditions.</p><br><A style="color:Tomato;">[est le texte de]</A><br><A HREF = "FAAA10070.html">Robo-Buddy</A><br></body></html>
