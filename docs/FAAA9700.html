<!DOCTYPE html> <html><body><p class="titre"> FICHE DU SUJET HARP (high-area rapid printing) can print almost 50 cm in one hour, that be a record for a 3D printer. It is a SLA pinter (stereolithography). It will be destined mostly to industrials, indeed a lot of factories could use 3D printing but do not do it because of limitations of today's printer (scale, delay, materials). Nowadays, a 3D printer is either rapide or large but doing both is hard for technicals reasons (materials break because of sudden change of temperature). Northwestern Univeristy find a solution by managing internal temperature depending on material and also by using a glue that acts like liquid teflon (for adhesion problems).</p><br><A style="color:Tomato;">[est le texte de]</A><br><A HREF = "FAAA9225.html">3D printer HARP</A><br></body></html>
