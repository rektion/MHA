<!DOCTYPE html> <html><body><p class="titre"> FICHE DU SUJET Apis Cor has already entered into several partnerships with a number of large companies around the world, including TechnoNIKOL and PIK Group, the largest building construction company in Russia. The latter has also admitted to having bought an Apis Horn which it plans to test soon. If the price of the machine is only available on request for a quote, the company announces a saving of 40% compared to traditional manufacturing techniques, or 103 to 155 dollars per cubic meter. The construction cost varies depending on several factors such as the thickness of the wall, the content of the mixture used or the location of the construction. In this case the cost of this house would only be $ 10,134.</p><br><A style="color:Tomato;">describes</A><br><A HREF = "FAAA32062.html">Apis cor</A><br></body></html>
