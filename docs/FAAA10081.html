On the way, the robot recognizes obstacles and reroutes on its own to avoid them. At the same time, a collision prevention feature will halt the robot if a person comes near. To maintain an awareness of its position, the Robo-Carrier uses lasers to obtain real-time spatial data which it compares with other spatial data acquired from BIM. At the lab, the robot lifts a pallet on which plaster boards with a combined weight of around one ton are placed, and then carries them inside a temporary elevator. They are repeatedly checking how the robot sets down each pallet, then lifts them again in the elevator to convey them to a designated location.<br><br><A style="color:Tomato;">is in</A><br><A HREF = "FAAA9927.html">Construction Robots</A><br></body></html>
