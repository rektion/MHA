Autonomous, excavation machines, dumpers and drilling machines operate remotely via a computer system.<br>On the spot, open pit mining seems fairly banal with one detail: all the operations carried out by these devices are carried out ... without human presence on site. Mining giants are also looking to cut costs and improve productivity. Finally, it is a means of strengthening safety and respect for the environment.<br>Rio Tinto is an Anglo-Australian multinational mining group that plans to automate its mines. It holds gross assets worth $ 81 billion, through a complex network of companies and subsidiaries.<br>The conglomerate automates the exploitation of all eleven iron mines it owns in the Pilbara. Thanks in particular to this tireless new production system, capable of operating 24 hours a day, with a minimum of surveillance and without prohibitive production costs, it increased its total production from 220 to 320 million tonnes of iron ore per year.<br>The haulage of ore is also automated. Software with artificial intelligence maps the mine and stores it in the machine's on-board computer memory. Each truck has a movement control unit equipped with a laser, a high-precision GPS, an obstacle detection radar and an antenna for connection to the wireless communication network. The on-board sensors and the mine map allow the dumpers to move quickly (maximum speed: 50 km / h) and safely. The central computer sends the information to the Perth supervision station, which analyzes it and determines in real time the trajectory of each dumper and the appropriate speed. If the radar which equips them detects an obstacle, the movement is slowed down or stopped. This helps prevent accidents. The Perth control center directs each truck to the loading areas where the other equipment is located. These are excavators, bulldozers, drilling machines and light vehicles, also equipped with GPS and wireless communication software, some of which are supplied by Terex Mining. The operators who control this equipment give orders, via a screen, to the dumpers to position themselves for loading. The dumpers automatically transport the raw ores to a remote-controlled train. "Drivers are getting harder and harder to find, a headache for expanding our mines," said a Rio Tinto marketing manager. In addition, the automatic piloting of the trains allows the scheduling of loading operations in boats to be reviewed in real time to adapt it to the pace of the mine.<br><br><A style="color:Tomato;">is used by</A><br><A HREF = "FAAA75.html"><vide></A><br>Acquisition of raw materials<br></body></html>
