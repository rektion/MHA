Our goal is to become the largest international construction company to solve housing problems worldwide.  <br><A HREF = "FAAA75.html"><vide></A><br>According to a report published by MarketsandMarket, the concrete 3D printing market is expected to grow from $ 24.5 million in 2015 to $ 56.4 million in 2021, or 15% growth per year.<br>Apis Cor has already entered into several partnerships with a number of large companies around the world, including TechnoNIKOL and PIK Group, the largest building construction company in Russia. The latter has also admitted to having bought an Apis Horn which it plans to test soon. If the price of the machine is only available on request for a quote, the company announces a saving of 40% compared to traditional manufacturing techniques, or 103 to 155 dollars per cubic meter. The construction cost varies depending on several factors such as the thickness of the wall, the content of the mixture used or the location of the construction. In this case the cost of this house would only be $ 10,134.<br>Apis Cor recently completed the 3D printed wall structures of a two-story administrative building for the Municipality of Dubai. With a height of 9.5 meters and an area of 640 square meters, it is the largest 3D printed building to date.<br>Apis Cor was able to conduct in-depth R&D work dedicated to testing equipment in difficult climatic conditions and developing 3D printing equipment.<br>Apis Cor, a company specializing in 3D construction, has just built its first 3D printed house in the town of Stupino near Moscow. Covering an area of   37 m2, the accommodation was built in just one day using an eponymous concrete 3D printer called Apis Cor.<br>Designed by a Russian engineer named Nikita Chen-yun-tai, the Apis Cor is a 3D printer measuring 4   1.6   1.5 m for more than 2 tonnes. Like many competitors printing from the inside, the machine is equipped with a robotic and telescopic arm allowing it to superimpose layers of concrete on a maximum surface of 132 square meters and up to 3 meters in height.<br>Launched in December 2016, the foundations of the building were erected within 24 hours, completed by various finishing works (glazing, electricity, plumbing, etc.) the following days. Currently in the completion phase, the project called Stupino 3D will serve as a showcase for potential buyers and investors.<br>Like traditional constructions, the walls are reinforced by reinforcing bars placed between the concrete layers every 600 mm in height. Thermal and acoustic insulation is ensured by ventilated façades or insulating foam.<br>To print large buildings and structures, several synchronized 3D printers can be used (see illustration below). The machine is very energy efficient, namely 8 KW, ie  5 electric teapots operating simultaneously.
