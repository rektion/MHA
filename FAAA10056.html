The robot determines how to perform the job, such as the steps for cleanly placing the welding material in the channel. The robotic arm, with freedom of movement along six axes, performs the welding. Usually two Robo-Welders work together on one column. To verify that the Robo-Welder can handle the channels in columns to be used in the construction of a high-rise building in Osaka, they have been testing the robot's functions by altering the shape of the welding channels.<br><br><A style="color:Tomato;">is in</A><br><A HREF = "FAAA9927.html">Construction Robots</A><br></body></html>
