We choose the project  Hyperautonomous Machines  proposed by M.Rohmer in september 2019. This project was very large, and our partner let us choose the direction we wanted to go in. We needed to find a domain that we were interested in to imagine its future. After a few weeks of cogitation, we choose to focus on industry. Our project started with a lot of information gathering on every technology that we though could be of any use to imagine our factory of the future. We then worked on different  scenarios  as we called them. A scenario is the sequence of steps necessary to go from raw materials to a final product in the hands of the customer. We thougth of products that would be commercialized in 50 years and come up with two really different ideas of scenarios: one for housing and one for toothbrush.
